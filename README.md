# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This project showcases my portfolio and projects, built with modern web development technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Framer Motion** (for animations)  
- **React** (via Create React App)  
- **Node.js & npm** (for package management)  
- **gh-pages** (for deployment)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the production build to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package.
